  <h3>Welcome to my website where we will be talking about Harry Maguire and his "meme" status.</h3>
</div>

  <p class="important">Harry Maguire joined Manchester United from Leicester City in 2019 for £80 million and since then has been subject to mockery as to whether he has been worth every penny, despite assisting Manchester United to their first piece of silverware since 2017 in February 2023.</p>

  <p>Harry Maguire has had his critics of his performances, which often comes with the territory of being a Manchester United player as many players will attest to in years gone by. With this scrutiny has come mockery as many fans of opposing football teams, and in some cases fans of Manchester United fans, ironically praise him and his performances. &#128579</p>

  <p class="important">A regular star in Gareth Southgate's England set up he was part of the England sides that have reached the World Cup Semi Finals in 2018, the final of Euro 2020 and the World Cup Quarter Finals in 2022. Listed below are his nicknames:

<p class="important">With the arrival of Erik Ten Hag as Manchester United manager his future as a Manchester United player was put into question with his game time decreasing as time went on throughout the season. And with the end of the season in sight, it is unclear as to whether Maguire will remain at Manchester United after the summer transfer window</p>

<h3 class="important">Examples of the mockery Harry Maguire has received</h3>
    <p>Below is a video titled "This is why Manchester United paid £80 million for Harry Maguire". As well as on social media, Maguire has been subjected to mockery from elsewhere, with a Ghanaian politician referring to their Finance Minister as an "Economic Maguire". More recently, Bayern Munich's Dayot Upamecano was referred to as "Upamaguire" by an Arabic commentator. Furthermore, in 2020, Harry Maguire was also involved in an altercation on the Greek island of Mykonos and was arrested but released. A few months later after a poor performance against Tottenham Hotspur where Manchester United lost 6-1, Manchester United fans created a petition to force the investigation to be reopened in an effort to ensure he would never play for the club again. And finally, on one occasion that went way too far and should not be condoned, Harry was also the target of a bomb threat in 2022.</p>
