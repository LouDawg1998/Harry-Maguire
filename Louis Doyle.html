<p class="important">Hi, my name is Louis, I am 24 years old and I am a graduate in Military History and International Politics from Aberystwyth University as well as Intelligence and Security Studies from the University of Salford. For the last two years I have been working for the teaching agency known as Teaching Personnel and have also worked in hospitality and on the Census in 2021. In my spare time I like to play and watch football and I am a supporter of Manchester United who seems to have an affinity for the kind of players who are likely to receive mockery, hence why I have made this website and why I have a Manchester United shirt with Weghorst on the back, another player who has received mockery since joining Manchester United. I also like to play video games on my PS5, especially the FIFA series where I also have an affinity for using players who do not exactly perform the best. Anyway, that's all I have for now, I hope you enjoy my website, if you would like to contact me, my email is down below &#128578</p>
